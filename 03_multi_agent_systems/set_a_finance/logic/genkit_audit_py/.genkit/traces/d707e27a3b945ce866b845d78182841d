Concurrently, mandate the integration of **proactive, performance-linked budgetary planning** requiring all significant projects and capital expenditures to undergo rigorous pre-approval, explicitly linking them to strategic objectives and measurable Return on Investment (ROI) metrics *before* any expenses are incurred. This includes the implementation of a zero-based budgeting approach for discretionary spending in identified high-risk areas, compelling annual justification for all line items. Furthermore, overhaul and automate the existing expense approval framework: revise and clearly communicate a **tiered expense approval matrix** with stringent, explicitly defined thresholds for each management and executive level, implementing automated workflows to enforce these limits and prevent manager-level override for high-value transactions. Mandate enhanced justification and budgetary scrutiny for *all* expenses exceeding a predefined standard threshold, requiring detailed business cases and specific budget line item verification, even for transactions approved by C-level executives. This will be supported by mandatory, recurring training for all personnel involved in expense submission and approval processes, focusing on updated policies, approval hierarchies, the financial implications of non-compliance, and the new strategic budgeting mandates. Establish clear **accountability frameworks and escalating disciplinary actions** for policy breaches and budget overruns. Finally, implement continuous, data-driven monitoring and regular spot audits of high-value and high-risk transactions, with a focus on identifying emerging patterns and ensuring ongoing adherence and systemic fiscal prudence.\"}}"},"displayName":"auditCommitteeFlow","instrumentationLibrary":{"name":"genkit-tracer","version":"v1"},"spanKind":"INTERNAL","status":{"code":0}},"ba79d9c316acd2eb":{"spanId":"ba79d9c316acd2eb","traceId":"d707e27a3b945ce866b845d78182841d","parentSpanId":"2ef79c188334e54f","startTime":1771931168989.471,"endTime":1771931179419.71,"attributes":{"genkit:type":"action","genkit:metadata:subtype":"model","genkit:name":"googleai/gemini-2.5-flash","genkit:input":"{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":[{\"text\":\"You are the Forensic Investigator on the Sovereign Audit Committee.
