    "summary": "The audit reveals a consistent pattern where all flagged transactions significantly exceed the general $10,000 approval threshold. While two high-value transactions (TXN-009, TXN-010) received appropriate C-level executive approval (CFO/CTO), two other high-value transactions (TXN-003, TXN-006) were approved at a manager level, which is critically insufficient for the amounts involved. This indicates a systemic failure in enforcing tiered approval limits or a lack of awareness regarding policy thresholds, especially at the management level. A review of expense policy communication and enforcement, particularly for non-C-level approvals, is highly recommended to prevent unauthorized high-value spending."

    "weaknesses": [
      "The current mitigation strategy is predominantly reactive, focusing on tightening controls around individual expense approvals rather than proactively addressing the systemic root causes of the 'HIGH' risk rating and substantial total exposure. There is no explicit plan for a deep-dive analysis into *why* high-value transactions are recurring or identifying specific departments, projects, or categories that disproportionately contribute to the risk.",
      "The strategy lacks integration with strategic budgetary planning and performance accountability. While it mandates justification for expenses, it doesn't clearly articulate how spending is linked to strategic objectives, measurable ROI, or how department heads are held accountable for the effectiveness and necessity of their expenditures, leaving the organization vulnerable to continued high-risk spending even with tighter approval processes."
    ],
    "revised_strategy": "Implement a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy to transform fiscal governance. First, immediately launch a dedicated **Forensic Spending Review Task Force** to conduct a deep-dive analysis of all high-value transactions and spending patterns from the last two fiscal years. This task force will identify systemic drivers of high-risk exposure, pinpoint specific departments, projects, or categories that are disproportionately impacting the budget, and recommend fundamental policy and process overhauls based on root cause analysis. Concurrently, mandate the integration of **proactive, performance-linked budgetary planning** requiring all significant projects and capital expenditures to undergo rigorous pre-approval, explicitly linking them to strategic objectives and measurable Return on Investment (ROI) metrics *before* any expenses are incurred. This includes the implementation of a zero-based budgeting approach for discretionary spending in identified high-risk areas, compelling annual justification for all line items. Furthermore, overhaul and automate the existing expense approval framework: revise and clearly communicate a **tiered expense approval matrix** with stringent, explicitly defined thresholds for each management and executive level, implementing automated workflows to enforce these limits and prevent manager-level override for high-value transactions. Mandate enhanced justification and budgetary scrutiny for *all* expenses exceeding a predefined standard threshold, requiring detailed business cases and specific budget line item verification, even for transactions approved by C-level executives. This will be supported by mandatory, recurring training for all personnel involved in expense submission and approval processes, focusing on updated policies, approval hierarchies, the financial implications of non-compliance, and the new strategic budgeting mandates. Establish clear **accountability frameworks and escalating disciplinary actions** for policy breaches and budget overruns. Finally, implement continuous, data-driven monitoring and regular spot audits of high-value and high-risk transactions, with a focus on identifying emerging patterns and ensuring ongoing adherence and systemic fiscal prudence."
