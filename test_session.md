# Session 04: Multi-Agent Systems
This session covers the architectural patterns for multi-agent systems, including orchestration, choreography, and the role of a critic agent.

## Key Concepts
- **Orchestration**: A central agent coordinates others.
- **Choreography**: Agents interact directly based on defined protocols.
- **Critic Agent**: Validates the output of other agents before final delivery.
