To address these risks, we suggest renegotiation of the following provisions:\\n\\n* The High Liability Marker should be revised to limit Party A's personal liability to a specific amount or provide additional protection against damages.\\n* The at-will termination clause should be clarified to specify conditions for termination, including notice periods and grounds for termination.\\n\\nBy renegotiating these clauses, we can reduce the operational risks associated with this agreement and ensure that it aligns with our business requirements. We recommend that the parties engage in an exploratory discussion to assess the feasibility of revising the contract and exploring alternative arrangements if necessary.\"}"
