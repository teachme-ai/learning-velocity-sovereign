# Finance (Set A) — Base Track: Sovereign RAG (No-Code)

Welcome to the **Base Track** for Finance. We will link continuous data folders to a knowledge base.

## Goal
Link Google Drive folders directly to **NotebookLM** for instant Domain RAG.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Create a dedicated Google Drive folder for Finance policies, manuals, and datasets.
2. In NotebookLM, click **Add Source** -> **Google Drive**.
3. Select your designated folder. NotebookLM will now automatically sync and ground its answers based on the continually updated files within that folder.
