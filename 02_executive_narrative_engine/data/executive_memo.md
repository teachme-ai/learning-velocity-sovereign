**Board Memo**

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**To:** The Board of Directors
**From:** Senior Corporate Auditor
**Subject:** Review of High-Value Transaction Flags and Systemic Risk Identification

---

**Executive Summary**
An analysis of recent flagged transactions reveals a pattern where several high-value expenditures, despite exceeding an automated $10,000 monetary threshold, have been categorized as "Policy-Compliant" upon internal review. These transactions include essential operational needs such as AWS reserved instances, specialized equipment for R&D, ergonomic workstation setups, and international relocation allowances. This consistent discrepancy indicates a significant misalignment between our automated flagging rules and the actual operational realities and approved spending policies of the company, rather than highlighting genuine instances of non-compliance.

**Systemic Risk Analysis**
The primary systemic risk identified is **Outdated Expense Thresholds and Policy Misalignment**. The current $10,000 threshold is proving insufficient and too low for a wide range of legitimate and often strategic corporate expenditures, leading to a high volume of "false positive" alerts. This situation creates significant **Administrative Inefficiency and Alert Fatigue** across Finance, Procurement, and Audit teams, diverting valuable resources from genuinely high-risk transactions and potentially desensitizing personnel to critical compliance signals. Furthermore, it points to a lack of **Policy Granularity**, as the uniform application of this threshold fails to differentiate between distinct expense categories (e.g., operational vs. capital expenditure, strategic investment vs. routine spend) that inherently carry varied cost structures and approval requirements.

**Recommended Actions**
To address these issues, we recommend a comprehensive review and update of the corporate expense policy. Specifically, we advise to **Re-evaluate and Adjust Expense Thresholds** for different spending categories, potentially introducing tiered limits for areas such as IT infrastructure, capital equipment, and employee benefits to better reflect current market costs and strategic investment needs. Concurrently, **Refine Automated Flagging Rules** to align with the updated policies, thereby significantly reducing false positives and ensuring the system focuses on truly anomalous or high-risk transactions. Finally, ensure **Clear Communication and Training** on revised policies and delegated authority limits across all relevant departments to maintain robust financial controls while facilitating efficient and uninterrupted business operations.
