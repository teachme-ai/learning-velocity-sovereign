## Board Memo: Analysis of High-Value Transaction Flags

**Executive Summary**
An analysis of recently flagged transactions exceeding a $10,000 monetary threshold reveals a consistent pattern where all identified items were subsequently categorized as "Policy-Compliant" by our AI review system. Transactions included significant operational expenses such as ergonomic workstation setups, AWS reserved instances, international relocation allowances, and GPU servers for ML training, all approved by senior management. This indicates that while the automated rule flagged these items based on amount, they appear to align with established business practices and approvals. The primary concern arising is not widespread non-compliance, but rather a potential misalignment between current automated flagging thresholds and actual corporate spending policies for high-value operational necessities.

**Systemic Risk Analysis**
The recurring flags for policy-compliant, high-value transactions point to several systemic risks. Firstly, there is a **Policy Threshold Mismatch**, where the generic $10,000 flagging threshold appears to be outdated or too broad given the company's operational scale and typical expenditures for IT infrastructure, specialized equipment, and employee benefits. This leads to a high volume of "false positive" flags. Secondly, this situation highlights **Policy Ambiguity or Lack of Granular Definitions** for specific categories of high-value expenses. While the LLM deemed these items compliant, the automated system still triggered, suggesting that detailed policies for categories like cloud services, advanced computing hardware, or international transfers are not adequately integrated into the primary expense rules. Finally, this creates **Inefficiencies in the Audit Process**, as audit resources are unnecessarily diverted to review transactions that are ultimately legitimate and approved by appropriate senior personnel, diluting the effectiveness of the flagging system in identifying true anomalies or risks.

**Recommended Actions**
To address these systemic issues and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of our financial controls, we recommend several actions. First, **Review and Update Expense Policy Thresholds** across all relevant categories to align with current business operations, common high-value expenditures, and established approval matrices. This should include specific, higher thresholds for areas such as IT infrastructure, R&D equipment, and large-scale employee benefits. Second, **Enhance Policy Granularity** by developing more detailed policy guidelines and approval workflows for distinct high-value categories, ensuring these are clearly communicated and integrated into our financial systems. Third, **Refine Automated Flagging Rules** by adjusting the system to incorporate these updated policy thresholds and granular definitions. This will significantly reduce false positives and enable audit resources to focus on genuinely anomalous or high-risk transactions. We also propose leveraging the LLM's "Policy-Compliant" feedback to continuously inform and improve the intelligence of our automated auditing system.
