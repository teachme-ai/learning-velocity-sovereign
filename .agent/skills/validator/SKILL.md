# Systems Validator Skill

## Purpose
No session is considered **Complete** until this skill has verified it.  
Run this after every new session or domain is implemented.

## Instructions
1. Confirm Ollama is running and `llama3.2:1b` is pulled.
2. Loop through all 5 domains × all implemented sessions.
3. Check each `logic/*.py` script exists.
4. Run each script in **Dry Run** mode (no Ollama call, just import + argument check).
5. Capture the exit code: `0` = ✅, non-zero = ❌.
6. Write results to `HEALTH_CHECK.md` in the project root.

## Bundled Scripts
- Use `scripts/test_factory.py` to automate this process.

## Usage
```bash
python3 .agent/skills/validator/scripts/test_factory.py
```

## Standard: Definition of Complete
A session/domain row in `PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` may only be marked `✅ VALIDATED` when:
- `HEALTH_CHECK.md` shows ✅ for that session+domain combination.
- The logic script exits with code `0` in both Dry Run and Live Run modes.
- An SVG proof has been generated by the Forensic Documentarian.
